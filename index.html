Created by Yoshiyuki Tomino and Sunrise (now Bandai Namco Filmworks), the franchise features giant robots, or mecha, with the name "Gundam". The franchise began on April 7, 1979, with Mobile Suit Gundam, a TV series that defined the "real robot" mecha anime genre by featuring giant robots called mobile suits (including the original titular mecha) in a militaristic setting. The popularity of the series and its merchandise spawned a franchise that includes 50 TV series, films and OVAs as well as manga, novels and video games, along with a whole industry of plastic model kits known as Gunpla which makes up 90 percent of the Japanese character plastic-model market.</p>

The RG line combines the best aspects of the other three Gunpla lines: The small size and affordable prices of the High Grade, the advanced inner frame technology of the Master Grade and the massive parts count and details of the Perfect Grade. The tagline for the RG line is "Excitement Embodied"[1]. Also, the RG line reflects what a mobile suit would look like if it were built in the present day</p>

                    Master Grade kits differ from other 1/100 scale Gunpla, with their level of detail, articulation, and proportions being second only to the Perfect Grade line. A majority of MG kits feature a skeletal inner frame with working hydraulics, some also accommodate Gunpla LED Units for light-up gimmicks. To give viewers a perspective of the Mobile Suit's size, many MG kits come with 1/100 scale figurines of the pilots or key characters of their respective series. In addition, some kits include 1/20 scale character figures.

The PGs are some of the most expensive Gunpla produced and have often been used to develop Master Grade and Real Grade technology.</p>
